    <h1><b>The Mentor Stage</b></h1>
    <h2><i>From ages 54 to 72</i></h2>
    <p>
        As a Mentor, you can continue the activities you pursued during your Builder phase and maintain your sources of income. However, your primary focus will shift from empire-building to sharing your wealth of experience and knowledge with the aim of providing guidance to those who require it the most.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>You have a unique gift to share.</h3>
                <p>Your greatest worth lies not in the mastery of tasks, but in your ability to navigate negative emotions, handle setbacks, cultivate resilience, gain a broader perspective, and exhibit courage.</p>
            </li>

                <h3>Sometimes just listening is enough.</h3>
                <p>In this fast-paced world, it's a precious and uncommon gift for others.</p>

            <li>
                <h3>Start small, then expand.</h3>
                <p>Begin your journey as a Mentor by taking small steps, then gradually deepen your commitment. There's no requirement to initiate your mentorship with an elaborate plan; you can progress towards becoming a fully established Mentor over time.</p>
