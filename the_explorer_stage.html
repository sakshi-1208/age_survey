    <h1><b>The explorer Stage</b></h1>
    <h2><i>From ages 18 to 36</i></h2>
    <p>
        Now is the moment to dedicate yourself to a thorough exploration that will guide you to the specific domain where you will truly excel and feel the most passionate. Avoid merely accepting jobs out of a sense of obligation or societal expectations; doing so will only cause you to miss out on the opportunities that come with youth.

                <h3>Exhaust each dream before moving on to the next.</h3>
                <p>Providing a lackluster effort and then quickly concluding that a pursuit isn't suitable for you won't suffice. It's essential to fully explore the potential of each of your dreams, even if it requires several years of commitment and dedication.</p>

                <h3>Take risks.</h3>
                <p>As someone in the exploration phase, you have relatively less at stake. Begin taking more risks to acquire the experience of pushing beyond your comfort zone.</p>
