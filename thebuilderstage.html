    <h1><b>The Builder Stage</b></h1>
    <h2><i>From ages 36 to 54</i></h2>
    <p>
        With a solid foundation of experience and self-awareness in place, you can now harness your talents to the fullest. Building your empire should be achievable within an 18-year timeframe if you have an exceptional plan and execute it wisely.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Spot your success trains and take calculated risks.</h3>
                <p>Maintain an open and receptive mindset, carefully evaluate all available options, and seize opportunities that resonate with your aspirations. Reduce the likelihood of regret by placing trust in your intuition.</p>

            <li>
                <h3>Double your efforts, but donâ€™t go crazy.</h3>
                Routine, everyday effort may not suffice, as that is what most people are engaged in. Dive deeper and maintain a high level of intensity throughout the Builder phase to accomplish substantial and meaningful outcomes.

            <li>
                <h3>Play to your strengths.</h3>
                <p>Avoid becoming overly fixated on your weaknesses. Instead, refine your strengths through consistent practice and repetition until you reach a point where you are unbeatable. Concentrate your efforts on becoming a world champion in that one area where you excel.</p>
